      docs: This API finds a Public Land Survey System section based on its section number, range, township, and principal meridian.
            For example, if you were looking at a survey plat in San Francisco, California, it might refer to the section as being section 31 in range R05W, township T02S, and meridian MDM. 
            This means that the section falls inside the survey township located 2 townships south and 5 townships west of the Mt. Diablo Meridian and its base line, and as section 31, it is the southwest corner of that township.
            This API enables you to download the GeoJSON for a particular range, township, meridian, and section number combination.
