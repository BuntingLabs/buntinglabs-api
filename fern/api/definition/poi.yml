            body: Welcome to Japantown, a vibrant and diverse neighborhood in San Francisco!
              The area is known for its many nearby Asian restaurants, and the
              convenience of having a Safeway right around the corner for all
              your grocery needs. The neighborhood is highly educated, with 29%
              of residents holding masters degrees. The area is very walkable
              and densely populated with 3-story buildings. The average home in
              the area sells for $1.2M. The nearby public schools are rated as
              5/10, it may not be the best option for families with school-aged
              children. But for those that work in the Financial District, the
              SFMTA 24 and 38 buses provide good transit options into the city.
              This is a great neighborhood for those looking to be in the heart
              of the city, with easy access to all that San Francisco has to
              offer.
